What makes it so different from other mausoleums is its unique architecture that incorporates elements of Indo-Islamic and Gothic styles with quite elaborate stone carvings and the circular winding staircases on all four minarets. It is beautiful and poetic in concept and execution.</p><br>

		<p id="literature">2.Uparkot Fort:<br><br>The Uparkot Fort dates back to the time of the Mauryan Empire and thereafter it was occupied by the Chudasama dynasty. It nestles in the foothills of the Girnar hills and it has three gateways enclosed one within the other. The walls are about 70 feet high with the inner gateway resplendently carved in stone. A huge cannon graces the courtyard and another one is in the southern part of the fort. Within the precinct one can find the Jama Masjid said to have been built by Mahmud Begda. This was supposedly the palace of Ranakadevi before Mahmud Begada conquered the fort. The tomb of Nuri Shah sits close to the mosque and has some beautiful carvings. The fort also houses two stepwells, the Adi Chadi dating back to the Chudasama dynasty and the Navghan Kuvo. One can also find Buddhist caves in the vicinity as well as the Baba Pyara caves that back to the 2nd century. However, it is the Buddhist caves that impress with their rock cut architecture and chaitya halls. It is believed the Buddhist monks lived here before going on to Ellora and Ajanta. There is a manmade lake, the Nawabi lake right inside the fort. The fort is large and it takes about 2 to 3 hours to explore it in its entirety.</p><br>
